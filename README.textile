h1. Phrekyll !https://travis-ci.org/lordelph/phrekyll.png?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/lordelph/phrekyll

Phrekyll is extremely flexible static site generator in PHP.

It is derived from the no-longer-maintained Phrozn project.

h2. Roadmap

This is a fork of the dead "phrozn":https://github.com/Pawka/phrozn project. Here's our roadmap to a first release

* Complete renaming of project in all documentation
* Ensure tests pass in PHP7
* Eliminate PEAR dependancies and ensure all dependancies are up to date and fit for purpose


h2. Philosophy

* Configurable: you should be able to tune it to your needs
* SCM-Enabled: no extra work to make your site git-enabled
* Focus on PHP 7 - if you want something older, use "phrozn":https://github.com/Pawka/phrozn
